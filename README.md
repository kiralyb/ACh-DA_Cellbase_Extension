# ACh-DA_Cellbase_Extension
Matlab analyses for cholinergic and dopaminergic single unit and fiber photometry recordings


This repository contains MATLAB code for data analysis on the interaction of the cholinergic and dopaminergic systems in broadcasting prediction error signals during associative learning. This code is an extension to CELLBASE (https://github.com/hangyabalazs/CellBase). The figures and supplementary figures of 'Cholinergic–dopaminergic interplay underlies prediction error broadcasting' by Király et al. can be produced with the MAIN_ACH_DA function relying on three datasets:

Fiber photometry recordings from the BLA (ACh) and the VS (DA).
Single unit recordings from the HDB and the VTA.
Fiber photometry recordings from the BLA (ACh) and the VS (DA) during the chemogenetic supression of basal forebrain cholinergic neuron.
